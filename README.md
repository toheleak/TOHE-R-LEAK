> ### Regarding this repository. 
>
> I was a former associate of the TOHE-R Discord Server. Throughout my time there, I witnessed Loonie (Main Dev) treating his staff, and contributors badly. They take credit for their contributors' and Karpe's work, and I think that's just shitty. Not only that, but talking badly about other mods too, just because they don't like the people making those mods. They also refuse to take accountability for bugs, saying "That's not a bug" when it so clearly is.
>
> Note: So, I've decided to publicise all of the TOHE-R Dev and Canary Builds. and, I will continue to do so as long as I have access to said channels (Currently looking for a workaround.), Thank you.
